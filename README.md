Me being stubborn and wanting to try my hand at making a tile editor. Started the project in monogame, but
I may port it over to Avalonia UI in the near future. (I have to learn XAML, and that framework first).

Please see the Manual.txt in the projject folder for instructions on how to use, and how to add in new textures to 
the editor. It is greatly advised to keep both the actual game project Content Filepaths identical to the filepath
in this editor project. Just treat the Content/GameAssets folder in this editor, as the "Content" folder for your game.

You still have to load the textures into both projects. Haven't automated that yet. Still learning and fleshing things out.

Enjoy! (Or don't. I dunno.)
